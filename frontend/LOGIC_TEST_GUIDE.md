# Add Logic Functionality - Test Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### Critical Fix: CSS Positioning
- **Problem**: Logic panel wasn't appearing because `.question-item` lacked `position: relative`
- **Solution**: Added `position: relative` to both Create_template.css and garment-template.css
- **Impact**: Logic panels now appear correctly below questions

### Missing CSS Styles
- **Problem**: `enhanced-delete-rule-button` styles were missing in Create_template.css
- **Solution**: Added complete CSS styling for delete buttons
- **Impact**: Delete buttons now visible and properly styled

### Enhanced Functionality
- **Added**: Confirmation dialogs before deleting rules
- **Added**: Console debugging for troubleshooting
- **Added**: Visual feedback for buttons (different colors when rules exist)
- **Added**: useCallback for better performance

## üß™ Step-by-Step Testing

### 1. Basic Logic Panel Display
1. Open Create_template or garment-template page
2. Add a question with supported response type:
   - Text ‚úì
   - Number ‚úì
   - Checkbox ‚úì
   - Yes/No ‚úì
   - Multiple choice ‚úì
   - Slider ‚úì
3. Look for "Add logic" button next to the question
4. Click "Add logic" button
5. **Expected**: Logic panel should appear below the question

### 2. Adding Logic Rules
1. In the logic panel, click "Add rule" button
2. **Expected**: New rule should appear with default settings
3. Configure the rule:
   - Select condition (is, is not, equal to, etc.)
   - Enter value
   - Select trigger (require evidence, require action, etc.)
4. **Expected**: Rule should be saved automatically

### 3. Deleting Logic Rules
1. Click the red X button on any rule
2. **Expected**: Confirmation dialog should appear
3. Click "OK" to confirm
4. **Expected**: Rule should be removed from the list

### 4. Console Debugging
Open browser console (F12) and look for these messages:
- "Enhanced Add Logic Button clicked!"
- "Add Logic button clicked for question: [id]"
- "Adding new rule: [rule object]"
- "Deleting rule at index [number]"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Logic Panel Doesn't Appear:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify question has supported response type
3. Check if `position: relative` is applied to `.question-item`

### If Delete Button Doesn't Work:
1. Check for confirmation dialog
2. Look for console error messages
3. Verify CSS for `enhanced-delete-rule-button` is loaded

### If Rules Don't Save:
1. Check console for state update messages
2. Verify `updateQuestion` function is being called
3. Check if `logicRules` array is being updated
